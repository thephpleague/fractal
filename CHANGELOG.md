## 0.10.0 - 2014-10-17

### Added

- Added `ParamBag` to replace the array passed to includes. It implements array access so keep using it as you were, or play with the new methods.

### Fixed

- Removed `PaginatorInterface::getPaginator()` as it was used anymore. [Issue #101]
- `Manager::createData()` argument 1 now hints against `ResourceInterface` not `ResourceAbstract`.

[Issue #101]: https://github.com/thephpleague/fractal/issues/101

## 0.9.1 - 2014-07-06

### Fixed

- Using ArraySerializer without a resource key would lead to an empty string as a key in JSON. [Issue #78]

[Issue #78]: https://github.com/thephpleague/fractal/issues/78

## 0.9.0 - 2014-07-06

### Added

## 0.8.3 - 2014-06-14

### Added

- Default Includes no longer need to be in Available Includes. [Issue #58]

[Issue #58]: https://github.com/thephpleague/fractal/issues/58

## 0.8.2 - 2014-06-09

### Fixed

- A `null` value for `Manager::parseIncludes()` could have weird results

## 0.8.1 - 2014-06-05

### Added

- Make `ResourceAbstract` implement `ResourceInterface`

### Fixed

- Fixed tests for Laravel 4.2 usage


## 0.8.0 - 2014-05-27

### Added

- Added Serializers with ArraySerializer, DataArraySerializer (default) and a provisional JsonApiSerializer. See [Issue #47]
- Added `ResourceAbstract::setMeta('foo', mixed)` to allow custom meta data
- Replaced `Manager::setRequestedScopes()` with `Manager::parseIncludes('foo,bar')` which can be an array or CSV string. It can
also take "Smart Syntax" such as `Manager::parseIncludes('bars:limit(5|1):order(-something)')`, which can come from a URL query
param: `/foo?include=bars:limit(5|1):order(-something)`
- Made all pagination (paginators and cursors) use meta output logic, so it sits with your custom meta data
- Moved `League\Fractal\Cursor\Cursor` and `League\Fractal\Cursor\CursorInterface` into `League\Fractal\Pagination`
